This copy of zlib-1.2.8 is a modified version of the original.

The following changes have been made to the original:

- Non-CMake build infratsructure has been removed.

- CMakeLists.txt has been edited to prevent building the Win32 resource
  data when being built as a shared library.

- Example binaries are no longer built.

- The GZip functions are now prefixed with "mcr_z_" in order to prevent
  function naming conflicts with Qt4/Win32, which has its own copy of
  zlib that exposes the same functions.

- The OF() and ON() macros have been renamed to _Z_OF() and _Z_ON().
  Based on Gentoo's zlib-1.2.8 patches.
